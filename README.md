Approaching Complex Problems and Websites

1. Understand the Problem
 - Clarify the problem
 	10 x 10 by default
 	9 mines by default
 	show remaining flags
 - Model the system and break the problem into pieces
 	See visual_model.txt
 - Research similar solutions
 	Might skip this beat until I need help.

 	HOW IS THE MINESWEEPER BOARD ACTUALLY SET UP
 	- Mines are randomly placed
 	- Every other square has a number attached to it depending on hoy many mines are attached to it.
 	- If a square with 0 is selected, all squares that are next to it until a square larger than 0
 	is exposed is exposed.

2. Come up with a Plan
 - Prioritize your work
 	Plan using Pivotal Tracker
 	Verify on Pivotal Tracker
 	TDD
 - Map out your strategy
3. Implement the Plan
4. Verify your Results
